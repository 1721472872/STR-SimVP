## ABSTRACT
> With the increasing global energy demand and intensifying environmental issues, the significance of
 wind power as a clean energy source has become increasingly prominent. However, the variability
 of wind power, particularly the ramp events caused by changes in wind speed, poses challenges to
 grid stability. To enhance the accuracy of predicting wind power ramp events, this paper proposes an
 innovative spatiotemporal prediction model. The model innovatively incorporates ERA5 wind speed
 data as model input, integrating temporal sequence variations and spatial wind speed differences by
 combining SimVP, Bi-GRU, and Transformer techniques, effectively capturing the dynamic changes in
 wind power. It is particularly effective in scenarios with significant wind speed variations during ramp
 events. The model simultaneously predicts wind speed and wind power and improves the accuracy
 of ramp event predictions by analyzing wind speed. A dual-loss function multi-task optimization
 strategy is employed to facilitate feature sharing and information fusion, significantly enhancing
 model performance and effectively preventing overfitting. Experimental results validate the model’s
 effectiveness in wind power forecasting, providing strong decision support for wind farm operation
 and management.
